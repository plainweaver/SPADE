##### Purpose: to discuss fundamental structure which underlies codes.
##### Please leave your thoughts. Feel free to open issues with any kind of arguments, in any form.

### Characteristics
* Multiple individual systems can be made from one script.
* Each of systems can make another system.
* Multiple systems can be combined and newly made into one system.

### Structure 

#### Shard System
 - Transport and Protocol
 - Have to reference some from libp2p

#### Particle System
 - Multiple memory & storage handling strategies.
 - In exmaple, L1 ~ L4 cache in cpu can be the one. Types of RAM or CAM should be considered.

#### Action System
 - Code analyzer
 - Compiler algorithms
 - JIT

#### Domain System
 - Categorizer
 - Pattern Recognition

#### Event System
 - Scheduler
 - Combiner structure
